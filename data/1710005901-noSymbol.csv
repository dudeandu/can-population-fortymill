Footnotes:
1,"Estimates for the quarter: Q1 = January to March; Q2 = April to June; Q3 = July to September; Q4 = October to December."
2,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (Table 17100059), international migration (Table 17100040) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100020 and 17100045)."
3,"The number of births is final up to December 2020, updated from January 2021 to March 2022 and preliminary from April 2022."
4,"Starting in the first quarter of 2022, estimates of births are produced by the Centre for Demography, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3601). Before the first quarter of 2022, data are from Vital Statistics – Birth and Death Databases, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3231). However, before the first quarter of 2011, the final estimates included in this table may differ from Vital statistics already released by Statistics Canada, due to the imputation of certain unknown values (province or territory). Due to incomplete births data in 2021, births data from Vital Statistics were estimated for Nova Scotia for part of the fourth quarter (November and December) and for Manitoba for the whole year."
5,"The number of deaths is final up to December 2020, updated from January 2021 to March 2022 and preliminary from April 2022."
6,"Starting in January 2021, estimates of deaths are produced by the Centre for Demography, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3601). Before January 2021, data are from Vital Statistics – Birth and Death Databases, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3233). However, before January 2011, the estimates included in this table may differ from Vital statistics already released by Statistics Canada, due to the imputation of certain unknown values (province or territory)."
